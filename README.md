# Scoop: Ride Share to Stop CO2 Pollution

## Project Summary

### The Issue We Are Hoping to Solve

Scoop addresses the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability and social isolation. It provides a platform for connecting individuals with shared interests and a common goal to reduce carbon emissions.

### How Our Technology Solution Can Help

Scoop leverages React and IBM Watson AI to create an innovative ride-sharing app that encourages eco-conscious choices and fosters social interactions. It offers a comprehensive solution for environmentally aware and adventure-seeking individuals.

### Our Idea

Scoop is not just another ride-sharing app; it's a transformative platform that unites people through shared interests and a commitment to reducing carbon emissions. By integrating React and IBM Watson AI, we've created a dynamic app that helps users connect and make eco-conscious choices while enjoying their journeys.

## Technology Implementation

### IBM AI Service(s) Used

- [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) - Powers the chatbot feature for user interactions.

### Other IBM Technology Used

Our solution also incorporates other IBM technologies such as [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage) for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Solution Architecture

1. Users interact with Scoop through a user-friendly interface.
2. IBM Watson services, including Natural Language Understanding and Watson Assistant, process user requests, preferences, and event descriptions.
3. The app recommends events to users based on their preferences and location.
4. Ride-sharing and event information are presented to users.
5. Environmental impact calculations are performed in the background.
